#Chapter One - Overview of Command Line Tools

Feel free to skip this chapter if you use the command line often enough. I want to go though a quick overview of the command line for those who may not be familiar.

Wether it's Windows, Linux or OS X, the command line looks similar enough. It lets you access your computer at a basic level by running commands. The command line lets you navigate files, create or edit files, or install new software.

Let's take a quick tour of come various commands. We'll expolore basic commands, then check out options parameters and arguments.

##Simple Output Command

Let's start by looking at a simple command, ```ls```. In Unix, ```ls``` prints out the contents of the current directory. This includes any files or folders the the current directory contains.

We can call ```ls``` with out any other parameters or arguments, although they exist.

Take a look at the following snippet:

	mead:~$ ls
	Library		code		Downloads	Public		Music
	Desktop		Documents	Pictures	Movies		src
