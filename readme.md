#Creating Command Line Interfaces in Node.js

Node and NPM are a great combination for creating and distributing command line tools. We're going to explore the command line, and create tools you can publish and use.

Chapters 1 and 2 are meant to get you up to speed with node, npm, and the command line.

In chapters 3 and 4 we will be exploring more complex functionality you can use in your tools.

Chapters 5 and on will consist of examples. In each chapter we will be a command line tool, getting more complex each time.
